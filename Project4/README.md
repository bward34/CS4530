Extra credit considerations:

1 - I have successfully completed the task of implementing a "MY GAMES" tab in which the games are
     stored and sorted by status, then by number of missiles launched.

2 - I know that the assignments spec say extra credit for this task is only given for substantially improved UIs,
     and while my UI is improved display, the place where it is substantially improved is with functionality.
     My UI now allows the users to swipe down on a table view which then refreshes and updates that tabs
     table view with the most updated games from the server.
